title: Implementing a compiler by LLVM and OCaml
tag: compiler
categories: system
---

I came accross the open source compiler project "LLVM" because sometimes I find GCC is not quite efficient for large project with many modules. I did some search and found out LLVM is a pretty cool open source compiler project and a lot of innovations are being developing on top that. I had experience with writing compiler in OCaml. So I'm gonna implement a simple language by using LLVM and OCaml for purpose of getting used to LLVM.  My ideal language project would be some language similar with Haskell or Go for supporting Concurrent Programming in natrue.  I will keep posting progress about this project. I think it will have a lot of fun. 

Hopefully, I can finish it in 1 month by using my entire spare time.
